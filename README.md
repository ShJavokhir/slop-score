# SlopScore

**Stop the slop. Measure what's real.**

SlopScore analyzes GitHub repositories to detect AI-generated code patterns, verify feature completeness, and expose projects that are more vapor than substance.

## What It Does

Give SlopScore a public GitHub repo URL. It returns a comprehensive analysis:

**README Reality Check** - Compares claimed features against actual implementation. Flags missing, incomplete, or misrepresented functionality.

**AI Detection** - Scans for telltale signs of AI-generated code: verbose naming, obvious comments, unnecessary defensive checks, type gymnastics, generic error handling, inconsistent patterns, and safety theater.

**Hardcode Analysis** - Identifies how much of the project relies on hardcoded values versus actual logic.

## Features

- **Simple Search** - Paste a GitHub URL, get instant analysis
- **Detailed Breakdown** - See exactly why a repo earned its slop score
- **Slop Leaderboard** - Browse the most egregious offenders

## Why This Matters

AI coding tools are flooding GitHub with repos that look impressive but collapse under scrutiny. SlopScore cuts through the noise to show what's actually been built versus what's been vibed into existence.

Perfect for evaluating:
- Hackathon submissions
- OSS contributions
- Job candidate portfolios
- Your own projects (before someone else does)
